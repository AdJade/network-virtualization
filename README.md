NetworkVirtualization
=====================

2009-2011 Concordia university

<p>
This project is about how to allocate resources in virtualized network. Network virtualization is a powerful way to run multiple architectures or experiments simultaneously on a shared infrastructure. However making efficient use of the resources requires effective techniques for virtual network embedding (mapping each virtual network to specific nodes and links in the substrate network). In our project we both consider the functional and non-functional attributes in the network. Functional attributes are those that don't change with time e.g.OS Type and non-functional attributes are those that change throughout the time e.g Bandwidth. Both node and link constraints has been considered in our model and the model has been evaluated with different topologies that we create using GT-ITM tool.
